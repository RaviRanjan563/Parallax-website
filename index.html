            <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time !</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes
                risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain
                climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to
                create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal.

                Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."[3]

                Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement:
                examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in
                knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers â€“ the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for

            </div>
            <p class="text"> Biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using
                specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate
                features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung
                shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically
                or hydraulically actuated disc brakes.
                <br><br>
                Mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack, back-country roads, wider bike park trails,
                fire roads, and some advanced trails are designed with jumps, berms, and drop-offs to add excitement to
                the trail. Riders with enduro and downhill bikes will often visit ski resorts that stay open in the
                summer to ride downhill-specific trails, using the ski lifts to return to the top with their bikes.

                <h2 class="desc" id="paragliding">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders:
                lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.The pilot
                sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by
                the suspension lines.

                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of
                kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.

                <br><br>
                The paraglider wing or canopy is usually what is known in engineering as a ram-air airfoil. Such wings
                comprise two layers of fabric that are connected to internal supporting material in such a way as to
                form a row of cells. By leaving most of the cells open only at the leading edge, incoming air keeps the
                wing inflated, thus maintaining its shape.

                <h2 class="desc" id="surfing">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem
                surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually
                carries the surfer towards the shore.
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are
                several types of boards

                In tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated with big wave surfing), a motorized water
                vehicle such as a personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a
                large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce.
